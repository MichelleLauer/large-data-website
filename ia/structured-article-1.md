Black tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, green and white teas. All four types are made from leaves of the shrub *Camellia sinensis*. Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than the less oxidized teas. Two principal varieties of the species are used â€“ the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (C. *sinensis subsp. sinensis*), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant (C. *sinensis subsp. assamica*), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white have been produced.
